# City of Melbourne Pedestrian Counting System: counts per minute

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Within-hour profiles and sub-hour validation (peaks shorter than an hour, event egress). The hourly table stays the training target. |
| **Provider** | City of Melbourne Open Data, `pedestrian-counting-system-past-hour-counts-per-minute` |
| **License** | CC BY (the dataset's licence field). Credit "Source: City of Melbourne Open Data". |
| **Access** | `python -m src.ingest.minute_feed --sync` copies the archive into `data/raw/melbourne_portal/minute_feed/` (needs bucket credentials, like `dvc pull`). |
| **Archive** | The portal keeps only the current Melbourne day, so the `stoa_minute_feed` DAG (`dags/stoa_minute_feed.py`) polls it every 15 minutes and merges each poll into one parquet file per Melbourne day in `gs://stoa-dvc-data/minute_feed/`. The same poll runs every 15 minutes on Northeastern's Explorer cluster through Slurm's `scrontab` (`ops/hpc/`), so the archive doesn't depend on anyone's laptop being awake. Each write goes through only if the file hasn't changed since it was read, so several machines can poll at once. Archived from 2026-10-25; nothing earlier exists anywhere. |
| **Update cadence** | The portal says every 15 minutes. |

## Schema

One file per local day, `minute_feed_YYYY-MM-DD.parquet`:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `location_id` | Sensor; joins the sensor tables and the hourly counts |
| `sensing_datetime` | Start of the minute, UTC |
| `sensing_date`, `sensing_time` | The same minute on Melbourne's clock, as published (the file's day is `sensing_date`) |
| `direction_1`, `direction_2`, `total_of_directions` | Pedestrians in each direction and in total |
| `polled_at` | UTC time of the first poll that saw this row (added by the archive) |

## What was found on 25 October 2026

- The feed holds the current Melbourne day so far, much more than the "past hour" in the title: at 16:04 Melbourne time it held 24,078 rows from 99 sensors, starting at 00:55. The start stayed at 00:55 while the end moved on, so it restarts once a day. A poll must happen before the restart, or the rest of that day is lost; the exact restart time and whether 00:00–00:55 is ever published are being checked.
- **Minutes with no one counted are absent, not zero.** No row has a total of 0. A missing minute is either a zero or no reading; summing a sensor's minutes and comparing with its hourly count tells which.
- **Two different rows for one sensor and minute** happen (2 of 24,078 rows that day; the portal's description mentions sensors 67-69). The archive keeps both as published and merges only rows identical in every column.
- `direction_1 + direction_2 = total_of_directions` on every row.

## Known issues

- Polls can be late or missed (a queue wait on the cluster, a sleeping laptop). That costs nothing as long as one comes before the day's restart; a day with no late poll keeps only what earlier polls saw.
- The portal's description is from 2020 and still mentions an issue with sensors 67-69.
